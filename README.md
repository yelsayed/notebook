# Study Notes

### Purpose of this

It's important to keep the knowledge of CS basics alive. That way you're not 
caught off guard when new opportunities arise. This notebook will contain 
questions that I encountered from Leetcode, HackerRank and other places as well
as concepts that I've forgotten that need studying.

Hopefully this will also be good material for blog posts and revisions when needed.

### Structure

Each directory will contain a subject. If there is no directory for a certain 
subject then I haven't studied this subject at all.
